Introduction
============

GeoAlchemy provides extensions to SQLAlchemy to work with spatial databases.

The current supported spatial database systems are `PostGIS
<http://postgis.refractions.net/>`_, `Spatialite
<http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/>`_, `MySQL <http://www.mysql.com/>`_,
`Oracle
<http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/index.html>`_, and
`MS SQL Server 2008
<http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/spatial-data.aspx?pf=true>`_.

GeoAlchemy is an extension of SQLAlchemy. It provides support for
Geospatial data types at the ORM layer using SQLAlchemy. It aims to
support spatial operations and relations specified by the Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC).
